# Numbers sound!

We can select mathematical constants representations in various number bases and
map it's digits to musical notes to be played.

We can also use custom numbers, so you won't be sad if I didn't put your favorite
mathematical constant in there. But it's relatively easy to add new constants in there.
We just need to have it's representations from base 2 to 12 with 2048 digits each.

## Examples:

### Pi in base 12 mapped to a chromatic scale

### Pi in base 10 mapped to a major scale
